  <h2>Fortune</h2>     
  <p><i>Fortune</i> is a short first-person level where you have a conversation with a Fortune Teller robot, talk about existential subject matter, and maybe end up with a sweet new toy! </p>
  <p>Created in Unreal Engine 4 over three months, <i>Fortune</i> was built to showcase skills with branching dialogue systems and scripting. Assets self-made (minus audio + base textures).</p>

     <p>
Built in Unreal Engine. All level design, art, models, textures, animation, scripting, lighting done by myself. Features include: UI Objective system which updates after each task is completed; a lockpicking puzzle, and platforming. Custom scripting was also implemented to allow for the player to pick up an object and move it around.
