<p style="font-family: Futura; font-size:20px;">I make games and write stories that explore neurodivergency, subcultures, queer & trans identities, and the spaces that exist between reality and dreams.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial;">I have worked in games for over a decade, and am dedicated to pushing the medium forward with inclusive, diverse, and meaningful stories.</p>
    
<p style="font-family: Arial;">Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary storyteller and believe in taking a holistic approach to crafting worlds for audiences to explore. Everyone on a team has something to contribute; I believe that immersive, believable stories are made better by collaborating with a team with diverse voices and experiences. </p>

<p style="font-family: Arial;">Iâ€™ve previously worked for several years as a co-organizer for a large studioâ€™s LGBTQ2SIA+ employee group, and am drawn towards projects and teams which prioritize inclusivity, diversity, and worker well-being.
     </p>    
   
<p>Outside of games, I work in film as a Script Supervisor. I'm a performance artist, like going on adventures, crafting light-up props, and editing clothes. ðŸ§¦ðŸ’œ
