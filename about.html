Iâ€™m Gav (she/they).

I make games that explore neurodivergency, subcultures, queer + trans identities, and the thoughts that keep you up at night.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-weight: bold;">I have worked in games for 8+ years, and am interested in pushing the medium forward with inclusive, meaningful stories and gameplay.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">I believe good design leads players in ways that make them feel clever, and gives them experiences from which to grow.
