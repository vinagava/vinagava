<h2><i>Deficit</i> is a Semi-Fictional Interactive Experience based on real-life ADHD experiences.</h2>
<h4>Navigate your way through several vignettes as you learn more about how structural barriers and attitudes can create a difficult environment for those whose brains work differently.</h4>
     
      
<h5>Created with: 
<br>
Twine (Harlowe), Google Docs, Photoshop, lots and lots of scrap paper.</h5>

<h5>Creation time: 
<br>
Approximately 9 months, released October 2020.

     <h3>What's this about?</h3>

<p><i>Deficit</i> began as an experiment in format: to test the waters of Interactive Fiction, and to explore storytelling in a medium with a low bar to entry. Twine provides an easy way to quickly iterate on a story, but with enough complexity to support branching dialogue. I was inspired by games like <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/"><b>Depression Quest</b></a> and <a href="http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/nonbinary-twine-game/"><b>Nonbinary</b></a>, and encouraged to start writing <i>Deficit</i> after describing in a tweet having struggled through a conference where I just <i>could not</i> pay attention. Subsequently, I engaged with <a href="http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/"><b>First Person Scholar</b></a> to eventually publish my work, and who gave me excellent feedback as I made the game. You can read my <a href="http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/deficit/"><b>Artist's Statement on FPS here</b></a>.</p>
  
 <p>The game is structured as a series of vignettes; in it, you will explore several scenes inspired by real-life experiences. I believe that powerful stories can be driven by gameplay, and as such, the experiences in the game are bite-sized, punchy, and varied — much like how my own attention span works.</p>

<p>One of the most rewarding experiences in making <i>Deficit</i> has been in the responses to it. Numerous people have left comments and given feedback about how it made them feel.</p>

<p>I've had people message me that playing it finally made them seek a diagnosis, or understand others or themselves better. A high school teacher in the US emailed me to ask if I could talk about the game and answer questions for their students. I feel humbled by how many people have shared and played my game — over 6000 to date.</p>

<h2>Design Intentions</h2>

<p>I wanted <i>Deficit</i> to be an accessible way for anyone (including non-gamers) to experience a slice of what ADHD life is like for some. There aren't many great examples of depictions of mental health in media - and those that do exist are often negative and harmful. In an industry which often struggles with representation, I wanted to contribute something that told a story, but also serves to educate and validate others' experiences.</p>

<p>I played a lot of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books as a kid, and loved text adventures. I wanted to capture the magic of both, but also distribute the game with as low a technological bar as possible. Twine was a natural choice, as was itch.io as a platform. With the only requirements being a device and an internet connection, I believe I was able to reach a very wide audience.</p> 

<p>A side-effect of working on this project was learning CSS and web development. Since Twine basically runs as a webpage in a browser, I had to learn HTML and CSS — knowledge which I used to make the website you're visiting!</p>

</br>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I originally intended to have more in-depth gameplay with some of the minigames. While others involved simple scripts that worked fine in Twine/CSS, one minigame required a <i>lot</i> more work than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>The 'Chop' minigame has the player chopping up a pile of ADHD medication with a card - for this to work, however, I needed to know the position of the player's hand, which necessitated using Javascript. While I eventually made a working version (<a href="https://codepen.io/v3na/pen/QWyozWg">playable demo</a>), I had a much harder time implementing the Javascript into Twine. In the end, I simplified the gameplay enough for it to work in CSS/Twine— which actually still accomplished my goals.</p>

<p>If I were to make another game like this, I would look into using Snowman (another version of Twine), which has better Javascript integration.</p>

</br>
<hr></hr>

<p>I also faced problems with packaging. I developed and tested primarily on Firefox— and did not realize until close to release that every browser parses CSS differently. Additionally, since Twine more or less runs as a website, Mobile was an additional hurdle. My scope had desktop play in mind, so Mobile suffered. <i>Deficit</i> is playable on Mobile, however — it just doesn't play as well!</p>
